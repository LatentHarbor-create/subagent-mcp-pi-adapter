## `launch_agent`

Start a new always-interactive sub-agent session.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `task_category` | one of `math_proof`, `security_review`, `debugging`, `quality_review`, `architecture`, `agentic_execution`, `data_analysis`, `coding`, `knowledge_synthesis`, `mechanical`, `prompt_engineering`, `vulnerability_research`, `molecular_biology`, `ml_accelerator_design`, `fallback_default` | Yes | Task shape; routes to the best provider/model/effort for that category |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Initial prompt text |
| `provider` | `"claude" \| "codex"` | No | Override; omit to auto-select |
| `model` | `"haiku" \| "sonnet" \| "opus" \| "opus-4-8" \| "fable" \| "gpt-5.5" \| "gpt-5.6"` | No | Override; omit to auto-select |
| `effort` | `"medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh" \| "max" \| "ultracode"` | No | Override; omit to auto-select. See haiku note.[^haiku-effort] |
| `deadlock` | boolean | No | MANDATE: ALWAYS set deadlock=true when, and ONLY when, 2 launch attempts for the SAME atomic task have already failed or been unsatisfactory - the 3rd attempt onward. Re-wording or splitting unchanged work does NOT reset attempts. Auto mode only: cannot be combined with provider/model/effort; from the 3rd attempt, drop those params. Passing false is identical to omitting it. |
| `sub-orchestrator` | boolean | No | Launch this child as a delegate-only sub-orchestrator for one disjoint plan section (swarm dispatch stage). The server injects an orchestration directive into the prompt and marks the child's env. The child's own sub-agents are normal workers and never inherit the flag. Available to the main orchestrator only (depth 0); rejected at greater depth. Omitting or `false` = normal sub-agent. |
| `cwd` | string | No | Working directory for the agent session |

[^haiku-effort]: `haiku` accepts any effort value but the effort is ignored : the Claude Agent SDK session takes no effort for Haiku.

Returns: `{ agent_id, status, provider, model, effort, task_category }`, plus `ruleset_applied: true` and `ruleset_original_selection` ONLY when the advanced ruleset altered the routing decision, plus `failover_occurred: true`, `failover_from[]`, and `failover_note` when a later candidate launched after one or more launch-time failures ([docs/spec/advanced-ruleset/visibility-and-failover.md](spec/advanced-ruleset/visibility-and-failover.md); [docs/spec/auto-mode/param-contract.md](spec/auto-mode/param-contract.md)). `launch_agent` runs zombie maintenance silently before launching; it does not return `zombie_report`. Culled agents remain observable as `zombie_killed` via `poll_agent`, `list_agents`, and `wait`.

`launch_agent` also returns `permissions_applied` (the applied ceiling plus rule and directory counts). When a ceiling cap applies, `permissions_applied.ceiling_cap` carries exactly `reason` and `source_paths`, and never parse text or config contents; an uncapped ceiling omits `ceiling_cap` (see [docs/spec/permissions/ceiling-modes.md](spec/permissions/ceiling-modes.md)).

**Auto mode (recommended):** pass only `prompt` + `task_category`. The server builds a fresh best-to-worst ranking for every call and silently traverses the full list on any launch-time failure, including provider-limit results before visible output; it keeps no cooldown or cross-call failure memory. Exhaustion returns one loud error listing every candidate and reason. Only pure-auto cost-efficiency routing receives eligible `providers.jsonc` API slots; performance and manual/override routing exclude them. The advanced ruleset runs afterward and retains final authority. A transient API launch-time failure gets one immediate retry of that same candidate before fallback advances; no other failure gets a same-candidate retry.

**Overrides:** `provider`/`model`/`effort` are optional and usually unnecessary. A provider-only override tries its matching candidates first, then de-duplicated auto fallbacks. Adding `model` pins the rank-1 matching candidate to one attempt; adding `effort` pins that exact triple. Pinned failures are loud and never substitute another candidate. `model` requires `provider`; `effort` requires both.

Provider/model constraints: Claude accepts `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `opus-4-8`, `fable`. Codex accepts `gpt-5.5` or `gpt-5.6`.

Spec: [docs/spec/auto-mode/_INDEX.md](spec/auto-mode/_INDEX.md) (param contract, presence→behavior matrix, exact error text).

---

## `get_status`

Return live in-memory MCP server session state.

No parameters.

Returns: `{ providers_loaded, agent_count, session_start_time, last_routing_decisions, swarm }`. `session_start_time` is the MCP server process boot time; hook processes do not write a state file. `swarm` is a snapshot of the agentic-swarm session: `{ active, current_stage, stage_name, pin_active, pin_expires_at }`. When `active` is false, `current_stage` and `stage_name` are null and `pin_active` is false.

---

## `poll_agent`

Get current status and output tail of an agent.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | string | Yes | UUID returned by `launch_agent` |
| `verbose` | boolean | No | When `true`, also return `final_output` (default: `false`) |

Returns: `{ id, provider, model, status, exit_code, stdout_tail, stderr_tail, started_at, last_activity, cwd, alive, idle_seconds, recent_stream, routing_tier }` plus `hint` when `status` is `stalled`, plus `final_output` when `verbose` is `true`, plus `ruleset_applied` and `ruleset_original_selection` ONLY when the advanced ruleset altered the routing decision. When maintenance culls stale processes, `poll_agent` reports `zombie_report: "zombies: <agent_ids>"`.

`stdout_tail` is capped at the last 2000 characters; `stderr_tail` at 1000 characters. `recent_stream` holds exactly the last 3 parsed visible provider-stream items, each with its timestamp. `alive` is `true` while the driver is open (`processing`, `stalled`, or a `finished` turn that can still accept `send_message`); `idle_seconds` is whole seconds since the last visible-stream heartbeat. Exit is reconciled synchronously on each call, so a closed driver is reported `finished`/`errored` immediately. A `stalled` agent is alive but quiet -- prefer `wait`/re-poll over killing it. A turn-`finished` agent stays alive and `send_message`-able; it keeps its concurrency slot until driver close, kill, or zombie culling. Polling it refreshes its idle clock, and it is force-killed only after 6 minutes of no `send_message`/`poll_agent` activity. With `verbose: true`, `final_output` holds the agent's final assistant turn text extracted from captured stdout; JSONL streams are scanned from the end with the same selection semantics, falling back to raw stdout if parsing fails. `routing_tier` is `cost_efficiency`, `performance`, or `manual` (`manual` = launched with explicit provider+model+effort overrides); it is omitted for agents launched before this feature (tier unknown). `ruleset_applied` and `ruleset_original_selection` are present ONLY when the advanced ruleset altered the routing decision for the launch (see [docs/spec/advanced-ruleset/visibility-and-failover.md](spec/advanced-ruleset/visibility-and-failover.md)).

---

## `kill_agent`

Immediately force-kill any open agent session (`processing`, `stalled`, or a turn-`finished` session still marked `alive`): `taskkill /pid /t /f` (Windows) or SIGKILL (macOS/Linux). Reports terminal `stopped`. Killing an already-closed agent is not an error. A turn-`finished` agent is force-killed automatically after 6 minutes of no `send_message`/`poll_agent` activity; call `kill_agent` sooner to release its process resources and concurrency slot immediately.

| Parameter | Type | Required |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `agent_id` | string | Yes |

Returns: `{ agent_id, status, message }`

---

## `send_message`

Enqueue a user message on the agent's existing interactive session. Only works while the driver is open (`processing`, `stalled`, or a turn-`finished` session still marked `alive`). Callers observe output with `poll_agent` or `wait`; `send_message` only reports that the provider driver accepted the input.

| Parameter | Type | Required |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `agent_id` | string | Yes |
| `message` | string | Yes |

Returns: `{ agent_id, status, message }`

---

## `list_agents`

List all agents known to the server (all statuses).

No parameters and no `verbose` arg. Returns token-efficient core metrics: `{ agents: [{ id, provider, model, status, started_at, last_activity, cwd_basename, alive, idle_seconds }] }`. No `hint`, no tails, no `recent_stream`, no `final_output` -- use `poll_agent` for those. Exit is reconciled synchronously per agent on each call. When maintenance culls stale processes, `list_agents` reports `zombie_report: "zombies: <agent_ids>"`.

---

## `wait`

Block until one or more sub-agents reach a reportable turn/process state (`finished`, `errored`, `stopped`, or `zombie_killed`) and return their details. A `stalled` agent is still live, so `wait` does NOT return on it. Returns immediately if unreported finished agents already exist. Returns after a 15-minute hard timeout with a list of still-live agents if nothing reaches a reportable state in time.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `verbose` | boolean | No | When `true`, add `final_output` to each finished entry (default: `false`) |

With `verbose: true`, every entry in `finished` gains a `final_output` field carrying that agent's final assistant turn text (falls back to raw stdout if it cannot be parsed).

**Happy-path return** (one or more agents just finished):
```json
{
  "finished": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "provider": "claude",
      "model": "sonnet",
      "status": "finished",
      "exit_code": 0,
      "exited_at": "2024-03-15T10:30:45+00:00 (UTC)",
      "elapsed_ms": 12345
    }
  ]
}
```

**Timeout return** (nothing finished in 15 minutes):
```json
{
  "timed_out": true,
  "elapsed_minutes": 15,
  "running": [...],
  "hint": "15 minutes elapsed with no agent finishing. Call wait again to block for another 15 minutes or until the next agent finishes."
}
```

Each finished job is reported exactly once per `wait` call (deduplicated by an internal `waitReported` flag). Calling `wait` again after a timeout will block for another 15 minutes.

`wait` also returns unreported `permission_requested` agents (alongside `finished`) so a parked sub-agent surfaces promptly : see [`respond_permission`](#respond_permission). Agents launched under a `yolo` snapshot never surface as `permission_requested` : `wait` auto-allows their parked requests, with the decision recorded and handed to the provider driver, per [docs/spec/permissions/config-and-lifecycle.md](spec/permissions/config-and-lifecycle.md) section 5.

---

## `respond_permission`

Answer a parked permission request for a gated sub-agent (parents only : children have no such tool). One-time only; creates no session-wide approvals. Available when `permissionsCeiling` is `auto`/`manual` (see [docs/spec/permissions.md](spec/permissions.md)).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_id` | string | Yes | The agent whose request to answer |
| `request_id` | string | No | Which pending request; omitted answers the oldest |
| `decision` | `"allow"` \| `"deny"` | Yes | Approve or deny the parked action |
| `reason` | string | No | Note delivered to the sub-agent; required when allowing a request flagged `escalate_to_human` |

The sub-agent continues regardless of the decision : a deny never kills it. Unanswered requests auto-deny after 5 minutes; the per-agent pending queue caps at 16. When a request is parked the agent's status is `permission_requested` and it appears in `poll_agent` (`pending_permissions`) and `list_agents` (`pending_permission_count`). `send_message` is rejected while any request is pending. In `auto` mode, irreversible residue with `escalation: "irreversible-only"` is surfaced as `escalate_to_human: true`; the orchestrator must route it to the human.

---

## `orchestration-mode`

Toggle or query per-project ORCHESTRATION MODE state (keyed by cwd).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | No | `true` = ON, `false` = OFF, omit = query current state |

Returns: `{ orchestration_mode, marker_path }`.

When ON, act as a delegate-only orchestrator for MCP-managed work; a non-delegable atomic step needs a one-time user-approved exception. ON/OFF is governed by session-keyed state; `orch-<cwdHash>.flag` is claim/carryover state only. DISABLE is never on your own initiative: only explicit user permission may set `enabled:false`. Codex CLI and Desktop inject per-turn state when both bundled hooks are configured and trusted. Without a trusted hook, the tag is absent and instruction fallback defaults to OFF. Pi preference and Codex native subagents remain independent of this switch.

---

## `model-selection-mode`

Set or query the per-project MODEL SELECTION MODE, which gates `launch_agent`'s `provider`/`model`/`effort` selectors: smart (auto-pick) or user-approved-overrides (30-min override window).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `mode` | `"smart" \| "user-approved-overrides"` | No | Omit to query current state |

Returns: `{ model_selection_mode, enabled_at, window_remaining_ms, marker_path }`.

`smart` is the DEFAULT (used whenever unset): `launch_agent` REJECTS any call supplying provider/model/effort (`value !== undefined`, including empty strings) and the server auto-picks the best model for the `task_category`. `user-approved-overrides` opens a 30-MINUTE window where selectors are HONORED, enforced LAZILY (reverts to smart on the next `launch_agent` call after 30 minutes); re-enabling does NOT extend an active window. HONOR-BASED: you MUST NOT set `user-approved-overrides` without explicit interactive user authorization via the structured-question tool; never enable it on your own initiative. State (mode + enable-timestamp) persists across MCP server restarts.
