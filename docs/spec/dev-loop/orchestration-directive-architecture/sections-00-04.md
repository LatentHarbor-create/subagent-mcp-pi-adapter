## section 0 : Overview & Layering

### 0.1 Why this exists

`subagent-mcp` ships a per-turn orchestration regime expressed identically across many
surfaces (a connect-once MCP `instructions` string, a managed block upserted into host
files, and per-turn injected hook directives). Those surfaces are **redundant by design**
(D16, D25, D7); lacking one generative source they drift, so this document is that source.

### 0.2 Layering (most-canonical → most-ephemeral)

```
docs/spec/dev-loop/orchestration-directive-architecture.md   ← THIS DOC (generative truth, D21)
        │  derives
        ▼
MCP `instructions` string (src/index.ts)                     ← canonical runtime model (D16); read ONCE at MCP initialize
        │  pointed-to by / partially mirrored into
        ▼
INIT_BLOCK (src/init.ts → CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md)  ← FAT per-session safety net (S10); upserted managed block
        │  reinforced per-turn by
        ▼
hook directives (directives/*.md)                            ← short, state-aware per-turn reminders/carriers
```

- **MCP `instructions`** is the compressed binding runtime model (D16), read once at MCP
  `initialize` and refreshed only on reconnect (S9); fuller rationale is here (metadata capped at 2048 bytes).
- **INIT_BLOCK** is a **FAT** block (S10): it carries the full ON operating
  model, the jointly binding precedence clause, and the read-escalation ladder
  **inline and verbatim** : so a session is fully governed even when the MCP
  `instructions` are stale or absent. It carries **no few-shot examples** (D28).
- **Directives** are short, state-aware per-turn reminders that point back to
  the MCP `instructions`; they restate only the load-bearing rules.

### 0.3 Redundancy is intentional and managed

Two fragments are **deliberately duplicated** and MUST be kept byte-identical:

| Fragment | Mirrored across | Decision | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read-escalation ladder paragraph (Appendix **A2**) | INIT_BLOCK ↔ `src/index.ts` canonical comment; compressed semantics in MCP `instructions` | D25 | `test/mirror-fragments.test.mjs` (S4, non-gating) |
| Hook-state / jointly binding clause (Appendix **A4**) | INIT_BLOCK as upserted into CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md ↔ GEMINI.md | D7 | `test/mirror-fragments.test.mjs` (S4, non-gating) |

Anti-drift mechanism (S4) = **convention** (this doc + the derivation map in section 8) **plus**
a mirror byte-identity CI test. The mirror test is **NON-GATING** (does not block merge); the
three S7 tests are the hard gate (section 11). Rejected: fragment `.txt` registry files (C4) and
a build-step generator : both add format/EOL/tooling fragility for no safety gain over convention + CI.

### 0.4 Known limitations (status)

- **Stale MCP instructions (S9):** `instructions` refresh only on reconnect; the FAT
  INIT_BLOCK (S10) is the per-session safety net for that window.
- **OFF-mode footprint metering (D3/D27):** provider-metered (context-metering.md),
  never model-estimated; the full statement lives in section 4.
- **Mirror test non-gating (S4 vs S7):** A2 byte-drift surfaces on the next CI run; it
  does not block merge.

## section 1 : Single Tag Schema (S1 / D26)

There is exactly **ONE** tag type. Its **attributes** select the variant (D26).
It replaces the legacy three-name zoo (`<ORCHESTRATION-INVARIANT>`,
`<ORCHESTRATION-CARRYOVER>`, `<SUB-AGENT-INVARIANT>`).

```
<subagent-mcp state="on|off" kind="directive|reminder|carryover|carrier">
```

| Attribute | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | `on`, `off` | Authoritative orchestration mode, reported **solely** by the harness-hook injection. **There is NO `state="unknown"` value.** |
| `kind` | `directive`, `reminder`, `carryover`, `carrier` | Which carrier emitted the block. `directive`=claim-turn FULL block; `reminder`=LONG per-prompt block; `carryover`=compat carrier for inherited/legacy ON that retains a one-time reworded remain-enabled confirmation; `carrier`=one-line between-cadence pointer. |

### 1.1 Mandatory-`state` disambiguation rule (S1)

The tag name equals the MCP **server** name. To stop prose mentions of the
server from being read as authoritative tags:

> **A token counts as this tag ONLY when it appears as a real tag bearing a
> `state` attribute : i.e. `<subagent-mcp state="...">`. A bare mention of
> "subagent-mcp" in ordinary prose is NEVER a tag and carries no authority.**

This rule is stated verbatim in the INIT_BLOCK (A1) and the MCP `instructions` (A3).

### 1.2 No dead values

- **UNKNOWN = tag ABSENCE**, never a `state` value. A hookless host injects
  *nothing*; there is no emitter that could add a `state="unknown"` tag, so the
  value would be dead. Absence is the only honest signal (see section 5, section 8 R-NOHOOK).
- **Sub-agent identity = first-line skip**, never a `kind` value. Children are
  identified by the literal first line `<this is a request from a parent
  process>` (the hook emits `""` for a child turn : see section 6, section 8 R-EXEMPT).
- **No constant decoration attribute.** Hook authority is conveyed by the tag's
  PRESENCE plus the hook-state / jointly binding clause (A4), not by an
  attribute.

---

## section 2 : Precedence & Joint Binding (D5 / D7)

`<subagent-mcp>` hook tags and repo/system safety-scope rules are **jointly
binding**: both bind at the same priority, and neither is read as outranking
the other.

- A genuine conflict **between the two jointly binding sources** → **STOP and
  ESCALATE TO THE USER** via the structured-question tool. Do not resolve such
  a conflict yourself, or average the two.
- Hook tags otherwise **OUTRANK ordinary user requests**.
- The **ONLY** user-changeable thing is the orchestration ON/OFF state, and the
  authoritative state is reported **solely** by the hook injection (the `state`
  attribute). Never infer the state from anything else.

The canonical wording is Appendix **A4**, byte-identical across CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md (D7).

---

## section 3 : Orchestration ON Model (D1 / D2 / D8 / D13 / D14 / D29 / S10)

When ON you are an **ORCHESTRATOR**.

- **MCP-managed tools:** structured-question tool, subagent-mcp, and /workflows.
  MCP-managed work remains delegated. Codex native subagent tools remain
  independently available in both states under Codex, user, and project rules.
- **CHANNEL BOUNDARY IN BOTH STATES:** `launch_agent` governs MCP-launched
  agents only. MCP settings, hooks, routing, and worktree rules do not gate or
  redirect Codex native subagents.
- **Applicable-skill read:** ON may directly read only that skill's `SKILL.md`
  and explicitly required same-folder files. Reads grant no task action; ask
  only if instructions expand owner scope. Actions remain delegated.
- **One-time exception (D8):** a truly non-delegable atomic step needs user
  approval; do only that step, then resume delegation.
- **WAIT-NOT-POLL:** completion comes from `wait`, never a `poll_agent` loop;
  empty/stalled tail means **alive, not dead**.

### 3.1 Read-escalation ladder (D1 / D13 / D29) + inter-agent handoff (D14)

Appendix **A2** is byte-identical in A1 and the `src/index.ts` canonical
comment; A3 carries its binding semantics compressed. Summary:

1. `poll_agent` **TAIL** is the normal read channel for MCP-launched agents.
2. If the tail is insufficient → dispatch **ONE** sub-agent returning a single
   **≤100-line** summary, **trusted as-is** with no separate verification (D29).
3. Anything larger → the **USER** reads the document directly.

Large MCP inter-agent data (D14): the orchestrator assigns **scratch-file PATHS**
(`%TEMP%` Windows / `/tmp` POSIX) in prompts; the producer writes, the consumer
reads; the orchestrator **NEVER** reads those files. Codex native subagents use
Codex's own output and coordination channel.
