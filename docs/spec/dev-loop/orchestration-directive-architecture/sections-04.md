## section 4 : Orchestration OFF Model (B / D3 / D4 / D11 / D15 / D24 / D27)

Orchestration starts **OFF by default** every session and turns ON only through
an explicit user enable. OFF removes the delegate-only requirement: inline work
is permitted, and suitable bounded work may still be delegated through
`launch_agent` according to the independent Pi session preference. AUTO judges
task fit, ON proactively delegates suitable work, and Pi OFF prevents automatic
Pi launches. An unset Pi mode follows explicit user and project policy. Neither
an OFF tag nor a missing hook tag changes Pi mode. Project prohibitions and
permission, model, and worktree rules still apply.

- **Provider-metered footprint (D3/D27):** OFF-mode footprint is now
  provider-metered (context-metering.md) and is never estimated by the model;
  the D3/D27 self-estimation note is RETIRED. Hooks lift provider-reported
  usage only and never tokenize or count lines hook-side.
- **Undetectable metering (D4 / D15):** when context usage cannot be measured,
  the hook reports `phase=normal` and preserves the explicit ON/OFF choice.
- **Phase constants (all FIXED, never user-configurable):**

  | Constant | Value | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | `PLAN_LATCH_THRESHOLD_PCT` | 15 | Triggers one-time planning coaching only while explicitly ON |
  | `HANDOFF_UNLOCK_THRESHOLD_PCT` | 20 | Unlocks voluntary handoff-write (goal-context capture) |
  | `HANDOFF_REQUIRED_THRESHOLD_PCT` (H) | 80 | Mandatory handoff write threshold |
  | `CODEX_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT` | 90 | Codex threshold and value written to Claude `env.CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` (H = CODEX_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT - 10) |
  | `COMPACTION_DROP_THRESHOLD_PCT` | 10 | Minimum drop (pp) to classify a sample pair as auto-compaction |

- **Phase definitions:** given `used_percentage` (0-100, or `null` when
  undetectable):
  - `null` -> **normal**
  - `used_percentage >= 20` (HANDOFF_UNLOCK_THRESHOLD_PCT) -> **handoff**
  - `used_percentage >= 15` (PLAN_LATCH_THRESHOLD_PCT) -> **plan**
  - otherwise -> **normal**

  `write_required` is a **derived** condition evaluated each turn (not a stored
  phase): true when `used_percentage >= 80` AND no eligible prepared handoff
  record exists for the current session.

- **plan phase (15%):** in an explicitly enabled session, a persisted latch
  coaches a one-time planning stop of AT LEAST 4 open planning questions (see
  sections-10-13, R-LATCH-15).
- **handoff phase (20%):** the handoff-write/read/clear tools unlock, with no
  mandatory action at that point; the unlock is a GOAL-CONTEXT unlock that lets
  the session record the goal it shaped at the 15% latch while it still has the
  context to describe one (see handoff.md, R-HANDOFF-20).
- **mandatory handoff (80%, R-HANDOFF-80):** when `write_required` is
  derived true, the hook injects a mandatory handoff-write directive
  (directive-only, no tool gate). The injection fires regardless of
  `contextCoaching`. On compaction detection (an adjacent-sample >= 10-point drop
  from a sample at or above 80% that is ALSO accompanied by a fresh structural
  compaction-generation proof from the implemented Claude or Codex adapter; see
  handoff.md) the hook injects a mandatory one-turn handoff-read directive.
  After a successful read, the caller asks exactly four structured confirmation
  questions before acting. `contextCoaching` does NOT mute mandatory lifecycle
  injections.
- **You never assert ON yourself in OFF mode**: inline work and optional
  task-fit delegation are both allowed; the hook alone reports orchestration
  state. Pi delegation does not turn orchestration ON.

**THE 5-CALL RULE IS DELETED (D11 / D24).** It is gone from the INIT_BLOCK, MCP
`instructions`, both tool descriptions, all nine directive files, and `hook-core.ts`
comments; repo managed blocks purge it on re-upsert. The provider-metered phase model
(context-metering.md) **silently replaces** it, and a permanent grep gate
(`test/no-five-call.test.mjs`, section 11) keeps it gone.
