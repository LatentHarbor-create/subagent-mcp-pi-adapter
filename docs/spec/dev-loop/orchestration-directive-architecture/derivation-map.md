## section 14 : R-ID Derivation Map (D21)

Each canonical rule fragment has an **R-ID** defined once here; every derived
artifact renders one or more R-IDs. Convention and the mirror test enforce this
mapping without fragment `.txt` files.

### 14.1 Canonical fragment definitions

| R-ID | Canonical definition (this doc) |
|---|---|
| **R-TAG** | section 1 single tag `<subagent-mcp state kind>` + mandatory-`state` disambiguation; no dead values |
| **R-SUPREMACY** | section 2 jointly binding hook tag + safety-scope; escalate-to-user; tag > ordinary user request (A4) |
| **R-SOLE-CHANNEL** | section 3 every launch in ON and OFF via `launch_agent`; native/harness/shell paths fragment permissions, instruction compliance, and context, so are FORBIDDEN |
| **R-ON-STRICT** | section 3 allowed-tools allowlist; no inline-by-right; one-time exception protocol |
| **R-SKILL-READ** | section 3 ON-only direct read of applicable `SKILL.md` + explicitly required same-folder files; no task action; approval only for expanded owner scope |
| **R-READ-LADDER** | section 3.1 poll_agent tail → ≤100-line summarizer → user reads; scratch-file PATH handoff (A2) |
| **R-NOHOOK** | section 5 UNKNOWN=tag-absence → notify + default OFF |
| **R-EXEMPT** | section 6 first-line `<this is a request from a parent process>` skips the regime; launch_agent upsert |
| **R-DROPOUT** | section 7 HALT-until-restored; only exit = explicit task abandonment |
| **R-MARKERS** | section 8 schema=5 markers + union MIGRATE_RE + duplicate collapse |
| **R-NO5CALL** | section 4 requires the permanent grep gate to find no 5-call rule |
| **R-START-OFF** | section 4 keyed sessions default OFF without setup-time state writes; keyless/undetectable metering fails safe ON |
| **R-LATCH-15** | section 4/10 15% latch + a planning stop of AT LEAST 4 open questions asked with the structured question tool (or natural prose where none exists), turned into the session's goal context; 15% coaching runs only while explicitly ON; explicit enabled:true may re-enable mid-session; unaffected by `contextCoaching` |
| **R-MODEL-SMART** | model selection unset defaults smart; server auto-picks and rejects selectors outside an explicitly user-approved override window |
| **R-HANDOFF-20** | section 10/13 goal-context unlock at **20%** utilization: unlock handoff-write/read/clear; write gated >=20% with readable metering; the 20% constant is FIXED and never configurable; 4000/8000-char limits; 10-question pre-write and EXACTLY-4-question pre-read coaching (voluntary) |
| **R-HANDOFF-80** | section 4/10 MANDATORY handoff threshold at **HANDOFF_REQUIRED_THRESHOLD_PCT** (80%): derive `write_required` when `used_percentage >= 80` and no automatically eligible record exists; eligibility requires `version = 2`, `lifecycle = "prepared"`, non-empty `generation`, and `created_by_session` matching the current session; inject the mandatory handoff-write directive (directive-only, no tool gate), regardless of `contextCoaching`; `CODEX_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT=90` and `H=CODEX_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT-10=80` are fixed code constants; compaction requires an adjacent-sample >= `COMPACTION_DROP_THRESHOLD_PCT` (10) drop from a previous sample >= 80 plus fresh proof from an implemented adapter (Claude: newest main-chain system `compact_boundary`, valid only when that exact boundary is auto-triggered with a canonical top-level UUID, so newer manual/invalid boundaries mask older valid ones; Codex: fresh compacted window id/number, with no auto/manual cause exposed); unchanged proof is rejected as replay; detection injects the one-turn mandatory `handoff-read`, followed after a successful read by exactly four structured confirmation questions; `markRead` advances any readable version-2 record to `working`, while other readable versions retain their schema |
| **R-TAG-TEMPLATE** | section 1 templated tag `<subagent-mcp state kind phase utilization>` + `Remaining Context=NN%` footer; any template/metering error => inject nothing |
| **R-HOOK-COACH-DOCTRINE** | contextual hook coaching preferred over frontmatter/system-prompt bulk; frontmatter only states that hook injections coach correct subagent-mcp use (prevents data corruption, hallucination, resource contention) |

### 14.2 Artifact × R-ID rendering

| `carryover-{claude,codex}.md` | R-EXEMPT, R-SUPREMACY, R-LATCH-15 (compat carrier for a current-session ON triggered by explicit enable; one-time remain-enabled confirmation) | : |

| `~/.subagent-mcp/settings*.json` + `src/concurrency.ts` (`contextCoaching`) | R-HANDOFF-80 (coaching-off isolation: coaching off does NOT mute mandatory injections) | : |
| `setup` context-coaching + auto-compact reconciliation (`src/setup.ts`) | R-HANDOFF-80 (write Claude Code `settings.json` `env.CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE = "90"`; read-back verify; restart messaging; report a present non-object `env` as unsupported) | : |

| `src/init.ts` migration | R-MARKERS | : |
| `launch_agent` (`ensureParentMarker`) | R-EXEMPT (enforcement) | : |
| Both tool descriptions | R-NO5CALL (absence) | : |

### 14.3 5-call absence gate (D24)

`test/no-five-call.test.mjs` asserts `/5[ -]?call/i` matches zero files under
`src/` and `directives/`.
