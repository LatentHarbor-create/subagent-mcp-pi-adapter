## section 10 - Persistence, Carryover & Disable

> **Truth sources:** `src/orchestration/marker.ts` owns persisted enable/disable
> records and `isActive()`; `src/orchestration/hook-core.ts` owns same-turn
> metering evaluation and `computeEffectiveActive()`. This section MIRRORS that
> composition. The old
> `docs/spec/orchestration-mode/_INDEX.md` "marker-presence = state" model is
> DELETED; do not reintroduce it.

- **Default OFF for every session.**
  `isActive(cwd, sessionKey)` returns ON only when a session-scoped key names an
  unexpired `orch-enable-<hash>.json` file holding `{ enabled_at }`; otherwise a
  keyed session starts OFF. A session-keyed `orch-disable-<hash>.json` holding
  `{ disabled_at }` wins when both records exist. Anonymous or absent keys read
  OFF because they cannot carry an explicit enable. Cwd-keyed
  enable/disable records are not written or read.
  The current session is resolved through a server-scoped session pointer
  (`orch-session-<cwdHash>-<serverKey>.json`, keyed by cwd + server `ppid`);
  on pointer miss, readers fall back to the legacy cwd-only pointer
  (`orch-session-<cwdHash>.json`) and still resolve to a real owner key. The
  legacy pointer is last-writer-wins across concurrent windows. **Absence of
  the legacy marker is not the OFF signal; absence of an effective keyed enable
  condition is.** The
  `orch-<cwdHash>.flag` marker is retained only for claim/carryover cadence;
  its presence/absence no longer gates ON/OFF. `src/orchestration/marker.ts` is
  fail-safe (never throws; failed reads -> default OFF).
- **Identity ladder is total.** Hooks resolve owner identity as
  `session_id` -> `tp-<hash(normalized transcript_path)>` -> typed anonymous
  floor `anon-<host>-<cwdHash>`. A non-empty `session_id` is always preferred.
  The transcript fallback resolves the path, normalizes slashes, lowercases on
  Windows, and drops a trailing slash before hashing, so case and separator
  drift do not create a new owner key. Residual caveat: a genuinely moved
  transcript still re-keys. The ladder degrades to the next-strongest signal,
  never to a guess and never to `undefined`. Empty `session_id` falls through.
  Anonymous owner keys are cadence-only: they can claim marker/reminder state,
  but cannot enable or disable orchestration.
- **Anonymous cadence is bounded.** Anonymous claims re-anchor after
  `ANON_CLAIM_TTL_MS` (2h, declared independently from the disable TTL): one
  FULL directive restamps the claim, then normal reminder cadence resumes.
  Corrupt, missing, or future anonymous claim timestamps fail the window and
  re-anchor visibly.
- **Time-bounded disable.** A disable-record is honored for
  `ORCH_DISABLE_TTL_MS` (~2h) from `disabled_at`; past that, `isDisableActive`
  lazily GCs the file and reveals the remaining effective state (explicit enable
  or default OFF). A user-approved disable is per-session and
  self-expiring, not permanent. Enable records use the same TTL and lazy GC.
- **Tool flips, hook reports.** The `orchestration-mode` MCP tool writes state
  (`enabled:true` removes the disable-record and writes the session-keyed
  enable-record; `enabled:false` writes the session-keyed disable-record) and
  injects nothing. If no session pointer is available, or the pointer resolves
  to an anonymous key, either mutation is refused. The separate
  per-turn hook reports the AUTHORITATIVE ON/OFF `<subagent-mcp state="...">`
  from the explicit session enable and disable records. Metering, Pi mode,
  and a 15% latch cannot turn orchestration ON.
- **Carryover (`kind="carryover"`).** An effectively active owner may encounter
  claim/cadence marker state written by an earlier owner. The hook classifies
  FRESH / CARRYOVER / SAME-OWNER from
  the per-owner claim map (`owners`, cap 8, evict oldest `claimed_at`) plus
  legacy mirror fields (`owner_session`, `baseline_turn`, `claimed_at`). Owner
  cap overflow evicts one oldest entry; it never wipes the whole map. On
  CARRYOVER it emits the provider notice (notify + ask-to-remain + advise-fit)
  prepended to FULL, sets `carryover_ack = true`, records this owner, and
  mirrors it to the legacy fields. The `carryover_ack` latch makes the notice
  fire EXACTLY ONCE per marker, while multiple live owners in one cwd no longer
  FULL-thrash each other after their first claim.
- **Disable:** **never on your own initiative.** You MAY propose OFF on
  task-fit mismatch (bounded/interactive/MCP-bound): explain WHAT + WHY and ask
  via the structured-question tool; only explicit user approval may call
  `orchestration-mode enabled:false`, which writes the time-bounded
  session-keyed disable-record above. Keyless hosts get only the one-time,
  non-persisted conversational opt-out. A new keyed session begins OFF unless
  explicitly enabled.
- **Directive read before claim mutation.** Hook code reads the directive body
  before it mutates marker, owner, or reminder-counter state. Env plugin roots
  (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, then `PLUGIN_ROOT`) are trusted only after they resolve
  under the compiled package root, npm/global prefixes, or known plugin cache
  roots; otherwise the hook falls back to the bundled `../../directives` path.
  If directive-dir resolution or directive read fails, the turn does not
  consume a claim or counter update; the hook fails safe for that injection
  instead of aborting the session state machine.
- **Latch persistence (planning coaching only).** When provider-metered context
  usage crosses `PLAN_LATCH_THRESHOLD_PCT` (15%) in an explicitly ON session, the hook writes a session-keyed
  `latch-<hash>.json` record (`{ rev: 2, latched: true, latched_at, session_id }`)
  once and coaches planning without changing orchestration state. Records
  without the current `LATCH_REV` are treated inactive and best-effort unlinked on
  read; this lazily drops bug-era latches derived from stale context-window
  arithmetic. The latch PERSISTS through the 20% handoff phase and the 80%
  mandatory handoff threshold and does not re-trigger its own coaching once tripped
  (no per-turn re-ask). It never silently expires mid-session (no
  `ORCH_DISABLE_TTL_MS` expiry applies to it); only a brand-new session (new
  owner key) starts latch-free, per default-OFF-per-session semantics. An explicit
  user `orchestration-mode enabled:false` disable-record (2h TTL, session-keyed)
  is honored after the latch trips. The
  `contextCoaching` setting does NOT gate the latch and does NOT gate mandatory
  lifecycle injections: with coaching off an explicitly ON session still
  receives 15% planning coaching; mandatory lifecycle injections at 80%
  and on compaction detection also fire regardless of `contextCoaching`
  (coaching-off isolation). See `context-metering.md` and `sections-00-04.md`.
- **Handoff persistence (project-keyed, cross-session cycle).** A handoff record
  (`handoff-<projectKey>.json`) uses the same git common-dir key as
  model-selection mode when cwd is inside a repo, else normalized cwd hash. It is
  not session-keyed, so a successor session working in the same repo/cwd identity
  can read what its predecessor wrote via handoff-write. The write/read/clear
  cycle repeats for EACH successor session: the next session crosses its own 20%
  unlock (voluntary goal-context capture) and its own 80% mandatory threshold.
  A fresh write sets `read_by_session` and `read_at` to null and becomes the
  stored record. Automatic transition eligibility requires
  `version = HANDOFF_RECORD_VERSION` (2), `lifecycle = "prepared"`, a non-empty
  string `generation`, and `created_by_session` matching the current session;
  other records remain readable but ineligible for that transition. On
  `handoff-read`, `markRead` stamps the reader and advances any version-2 record
  to `working`, even when its lifecycle or generation is incomplete; other
  readable versions retain their schema.
  Only the session that ran handoff-read (`read_by_session === current`)
  re-appends the saved content verbatim to its LONG reminders. See `handoff.md`.
- **Atomic state writes.** Every marker/state file (`orch-<cwdHash>.flag`, the
  session-keyed enable/disable and latch records, reminder counters, and both
  session pointers)
  is written through
  `atomicWriteFile`/`atomicWriteJson` (`src/orchestration/atomic-write.ts`):
  write to a unique sibling `.<name>.<pid>.<time>.<rand>.tmp`, then `rename`
  onto the target so a concurrent reader sees either the whole old file or the
  whole new one, never a torn write. On a Windows `EEXIST`/`EPERM` rename over
  an existing target, it unlinks the target and retries; on any write/rename
  failure it best-effort unlinks the temp so no `.tmp` litter is left behind.
  This preserves the module's fail-safe contract (never throws to the hook).
  Reminder-counter updates are also serialized under the process-local cwd lock
  before the atomic temp-file write and rename.
- **No automatic ON.** Keyless/no-tag hosts, missing metering, and the 15%
  threshold all leave orchestration OFF. Only an explicit session enable-record
  turns it ON; a session disable-record overrides that enable. See section 5
  (D18/D6) and the section 9 host matrix.

## section 11 - Tests (S7 gating + S4 non-gating)

### 11.1 GATING (S7) - block merge

| Test | Asserts | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `test/launch-agent-upsert.test.mjs` | `ensureParentMarker` upsert + shared `hasParentMarker` coherence | D20 / S8 |
| `test/no-five-call.test.mjs` | `/5[ -]?call/i` matches **zero** files under `src/` and `directives/` | D11 / D24 |
| `test/init-migration.test.mjs` | v1/schema=2 block -> exactly one schema=3 block in-place (`updated`); double-legacy -> collapsed to one; schema=3 present -> idempotent (`ok`); one write per call | D22 / S3 |

### 11.2 NON-GATING (S4) - must exist before ship, does not block merge

| Test | Asserts | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `test/mirror-fragments.test.mjs` | A2 read-ladder byte-identical in INIT_BLOCK <-> MCP `instructions`; A4 supremacy clause byte-identical across the three host files | D25 / D7 |

## section 12 - Failure-Mode Matrix

| Failure mode | Behavior | Explicit suppressor / exit |
|---|---|---|
| subagent-mcp dropout while ON | HALT-until-restored; nothing inline (section 7) | user explicitly abandons the whole task (S5): ends task, never inline-degrades |
| No hook injection (hookless host) | UNKNOWN (tag absence) -> notify -> **default OFF** (section 5) | sub-agent first-line exemption |
| Fail-safe-ON recursion / fork-bomb | child would re-orchestrate | **first-line exemption** (section 6) + `launch_agent` silent upsert (A7) |
| Hook execution error | hook emits `""`; turn never crashes | n/a (fail-open to no-injection, which the host handles per section 5) |
| Stale MCP `instructions` (S9) | FAT INIT_BLOCK governs the session | reconnect refresh (S9) |

---

## section 13 - Cross-Provider / Structured-Question Tool Map

| Provider | Structured-question tool | Directive variants |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `AskUserQuestion` | `orchestration-claude.md`, `carryover-claude.md`, `reminder-off-claude.md` |
| Codex | `request-user-input` | `orchestration-codex.md`, `carryover-codex.md`, `reminder-off-codex.md` |
| Shared | (per active provider) | `reminder-on.md`, `short-on.md`, `short-off.md` |

ProviderAdapter filenames are unchanged (hook-core contract preserved).

### 13.1 Coaching structured-question map (metered lifecycle)

The metered latch/handoff coaching mandates exact question counts and call
splits per harness. These rows are binding.

| Coaching trigger | Questions | Claude call shape | Codex call shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15% latch (plan phase) | AT LEAST 4 | structured question tool (`AskUserQuestion`), or natural prose if unavailable | structured question tool (`request-user-input`), or natural prose if unavailable |
| handoff-write pre-write (>=20% voluntary OR >=80% mandatory) | 10 | three `AskUserQuestion` calls (4+4+2; each call takes at most 4 questions) | one `request-user-input` call carrying all 10 |
| handoff-read pre-act (voluntary) | 4 | one call | one call |
| mandatory handoff-read (`session_handoff_required`) | EXACTLY 4 after a successful read | one `AskUserQuestion` call | one `request-user-input` call |

The latch row is deliberately harness-NEUTRAL and count-OPEN: one verbatim
string ships in both latch directives, it names the structured question tool
generically, and it permits natural prose where no such tool exists. The
voluntary and mandatory handoff-read rows both require EXACTLY 4 confirmation
questions after a successful read. The one-turn
`session_handoff_required` directive supplies the instruction; the
`handoff-read` tool returns the same contract, and the caller performs the
structured-question call before acting. This behavior is not muted by
`contextCoaching`.

Latch coaching bodies live in `directives/latch-claude.md` / `latch-codex.md`;
handoff coaching bodies in `directives/handoff-claude.md` / `handoff-codex.md`.
