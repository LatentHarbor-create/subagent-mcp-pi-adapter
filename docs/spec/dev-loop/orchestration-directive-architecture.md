## One-screen summary

`subagent-mcp` ships a per-turn orchestration regime expressed redundantly across
three surfaces (MCP `instructions`, upserted `INIT_BLOCK`, per-turn hook
directives). ON = delegate-only orchestration for MCP-managed work. OFF permits
inline work and task-fit MCP delegation under a separate Pi preference, plus provider-metered context tracking
(context-metering.md); planning coaching at 15% only while explicitly ON, with the handoff tools
unlocking at 20% (voluntary goal-context capture) and a mandatory handoff-write
directive firing at 80% (HANDOFF_REQUIRED_THRESHOLD_PCT = CODEX_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT
- 10; directive-only, coaching-off isolation); compaction detected when a single
adjacent-sample >= 10-point drop from >= 80% is ALSO accompanied by a fresh
structural compaction-generation proof (Claude: newest main-chain system
`compact_boundary`, valid only when that exact boundary is auto-triggered and
has a canonical top-level UUID; Codex: fresh compacted window id/number). This
triggers a mandatory one-turn handoff-read injection followed, after a
successful read, by exactly four structured confirmation questions (see
R-LATCH-15/R-HANDOFF-20/R-HANDOFF-80). State is reported SOLELY by the hook
`<subagent-mcp state="...">` tag; hookless hosts → UNKNOWN → default OFF.
Sub-agent first-line marker skips the whole regime.

Orchestration mode is **orthogonal** to the permission system: orchestration
mode governs *who* decides to delegate work to sub-agents; `permissionsCeiling`
(`docs/spec/permissions.md`) governs *what* a launched sub-agent may do without
escalation. The `permission_requested` status and the `respond_permission` tool
belong to the permission system, not this regime. (Note: the Claude PreToolUse
gate `src/orchestration/pretool.ts` denies the harness-native `Agent` launcher
for orchestrators **and** sub-agents alike : the SOLE-CHANNEL fork-bomb
guard, see `sections-05-09.md` section 6.3; Task widget tools and Explore are
not denied by the hook; it does **not** make a launched child's permission
decisions : those run through the shared engine in `src/drivers.ts`.)

## Swarm and sub-orchestrator retrieval

| Topic | Leaf |
|-------|------|
| Agentic swarm workflow (7-stage machine, pin design, anti-gaming rationale) | `docs/spec/swarm/_INDEX.md` |
| Performance pin / swarm routing (arm/restart/auto-off, call-site, branch selection) | `docs/spec/swarm/_INDEX.md`, `docs/spec/auto-mode/routing-table-contract.md` |
| Sub-orchestrators (directive, env marker, depth gate, anti-inheritance, hook emission) | `docs/spec/swarm/_INDEX.md`, `orchestration-directive-architecture/appendix-a5-directives.md` |

These entries are MAP ONLY. All normative content for swarm and sub-orchestrator lives in
`docs/spec/swarm/_INDEX.md` and `docs/spec/auto-mode/` leaves, NOT in this retrieval map.
