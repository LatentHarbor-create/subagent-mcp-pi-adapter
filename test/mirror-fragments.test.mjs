/**
 * Mirror-fragments byte-identity test (S4/D25/D7) — GATING.
 *
 * Two governance fragments are duplicated across source files by design and
 * MUST never drift:
 *
 *   A2 — the READ-ESCALATION LADDER paragraph. It is carried verbatim in BOTH
 *        the INIT_BLOCK template (src/init.ts, upserted into the host
 *        instruction files) AND the MCP `instructions` string
 *        (ORCHESTRATION_INSTRUCTIONS in src/index.ts, read once at connect).
 *        These two copies must be BYTE-IDENTICAL.
 *
 *   A4 — the jointly binding precedence clause. It lives inside the
 *        single shared INIT_BLOCK, so all three host files (CLAUDE.md /
 *        AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md) are identical by construction once it is
 *        present verbatim in that one block.
 *
 * Strategy: read the two source files as TEXT and assert the exact A2 paragraph
 * is a substring of BOTH (byte-identity by shared-substring), and that the A4
 * clause is a substring of src/init.ts. Reading source text (rather than
 * importing dist) keeps the assertion at the literal-bytes level, which is what
 * "byte-identical" means here. A failure means real drift exists — the diff of
 * the two A2 copies is printed so it can be fixed.
 *
 * This test IS wired into `npm test` (see package.json) and therefore gates
 * CI: it documents/guards the invariant and reports drift, and a failure
 * fails the required test run rather than merely warning.
